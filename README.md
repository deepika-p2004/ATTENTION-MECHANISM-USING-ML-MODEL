# ATTENTION-DRIFT-DURATION-PREDICTION-USING-ML-MODEL

The Attention Drift Duration Predictor is a machine learning regression application designed to predict the exact duration of attention drift episodes during work and study activities. Unlike classification approaches that categorize drift into severity levels, this system aims to predict the precise number of minutes an attention drift episode will last based on quantifiable attributes such as activity type, environmental conditions (noise
level, lighting, temperature), personal state (energy level, mood, stress), temporal patterns, and contextual factors.
The project bridges the gap between cognitive science and artificial intelligence by transforming qualitative focus experiences into quantitative duration predictions. By analyzing patterns in how various factors correlate with drift duration, we can forecast the length of productivity interruptions before they occur.
